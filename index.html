                    A graduate of a Computer Science degree and currently strictly a freelancer focusing on C/ C++ and
                    Cybersecurity. I am advancing in C/C++ for lower or middle level development and of course trying
                    new things like Bufferoverflow, packet sniffer development tool, dynamic programming and of course
                    chipset development.
                    The latest years and I am refering from 2018 to 2025 the industry has rapidly change with extremely
                    high surge on AI and due to the "programming" influencers. I have been learning new things on and
                    off every Summer, Easter and Christmas and to make ends meet I got a job as a hardware engineer.
                    Despite having learnt so much about OSI model, programming languages and ethical
                    hacking....everything seems straight up impossible to achieve not because our struggle leads into an
                    abyss but because the abyss will always make us better inventors. That's why I am on and taking
                    regular breaks from but I withdraw new skills, one step at a time of course.
                    Elite in Java because I began with Java in 2021.
                    Proficient in HTML/CSS, PHP, JavaScript,Python,SQL.
                    Intermediate in C/C++.</i></p>
